# Text analaysis of Isle Royale EIS public comments via AI tools

In this project, I explored using chatGPT, text embeddings, and Claude2 to analyze public comments on a complex environmental management decision. I demo methods to responsibly validate output classifications from LLMs. While not perfect, chatGPT showed promising reliability at categorizing free-form opinions. The text embeddings uncovered hidden topical clusters among comments that traditional methods would have missed. Claude2â€™s long context window allowed for further interpretation of the topical clusters. Together, these tools enabled a nuanced quantitative analysis of subjective text data that would be infeasible for a single human analyst to perform manually.
